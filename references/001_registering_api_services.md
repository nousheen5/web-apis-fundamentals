In ASP.NET Core, registering API services within the dependency injection (DI) container is a crucial step for enabling loose coupling and testability. This involves adding service implementations (classes) and their corresponding interfaces to the DI container, typically within the ConfigureServices method in Startup.cs or in the Program.cs file in newer .NET versions. This allows your application to resolve these services through their interfaces in controllers or other classes, promoting clean architecture and easier maintenance. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Here's a breakdown of the process: 
1. Define Interfaces and Implementations: 

• First, define interfaces that represent the services you want to use. For example: [5, 6]  

     public interface IUserService
     {
         string GetUserName(int userId);
     }

• Then, create concrete classes that implement these interfaces: [2, 7, 8]  

     public class UserService : IUserService
     {
         public string GetUserName(int userId)
         {
             // Implementation details
             return "User Name";
         }
     }

2. Register Services with the DI Container: 

• In your Startup.cs (or Program.cs in .NET 6+), use the services collection to register your services. There are three main service lifetimes: 
	• Transient: A new instance is created every time the service is requested. [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]  

       services.AddTransient<IUserService, UserService>();

• Scoped: A new instance is created once per client request (e.g., within an HTTP request). [15, 16, 17]  

       services.AddScoped<IUserService, UserService>();

• Singleton: A single instance is created and shared throughout the application's lifetime. [13, 18, 19]  

       services.AddSingleton<IUserService, UserService>();

3. Inject Services into Controllers (or other classes): [1, 20]  

• In your controller (or any class that needs the service), use constructor injection to receive the service instance: [21, 22]  

     public class UserController : ControllerBase
     {
         private readonly IUserService _userService;

         public UserController(IUserService userService)
         {
             _userService = userService;
         }

         [HttpGet("{id}")]
         public IActionResult Get(int id)
         {
             var userName = _userService.GetUserName(id);
             return Ok(userName);
         }
     }

Example: 
Let's say you have a UserService that needs to be injected into a UserController. [2, 20, 23, 24, 25]  

1. Define the interface and implementation: 

   public interface IUserService {
       string GetUserName(int id);
   }

   public class UserService : IUserService {
       public string GetUserName(int id) {
           // In a real application, this would likely interact with a database
           return $"User Name for ID: {id}";
       }
   }

1. Register the service in Startup.cs (or Program.cs): [25, 26]  

   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
   {
       services.AddControllers();
       services.AddScoped<IUserService, UserService>(); //Scoped lifetime
   }

1. Inject the service into the controller: [20, 27]  

   [ApiController]
   [Route("[controller]")]
   public class UserController : ControllerBase {
       private readonly IUserService _userService;

       public UserController(IUserService userService) {
           _userService = userService;
       }

       [HttpGet("{id}")]
       public ActionResult<string> Get(int id) {
           var userName = _userService.GetUserName(id);
           return userName;
       }
   }

This approach ensures that your API is loosely coupled, making it easier to test and maintain. Using constructor injection also clearly shows the dependencies of your classes. [1, 2, 28, 29]
